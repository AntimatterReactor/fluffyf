- [ ] frustrating: implement methods and traits for API objects
- [ ] painful: switch from reqwest to hyper + rustls/native-tls
- [ ] annoying: document thoroughly:
    - [ ] posts
    - [ ] pools
    - [ ] connect and connect::methods
    - [ ] favorites
    - [ ] search
    - [ ] tags
    - [ ] notes
    - [ ] post\_flags
- [x] coagulate all use statements
- [ ] implement Stream items for Pool and Post
- [x] original idea was correct: rename to remove plurality (pools => pool)
- [x] remove `Object` suffix from the objects
- [ ] create Search types per object and traits for those Search types
- [x] rust 1.75 stabilized async fn traits in traits:
    - [x] remove async\_traits dependency
    - [x] add minimum supported rust version (MSRV) to 1.75
        - [x] document/explain why the MSRV is so high
    - [x] install rustup (forgot to do this)
- [ ] after most of the above: release to public + crates.io
- [ ] add wasm support
