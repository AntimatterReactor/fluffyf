# fluffyf

fluffyf is pretty much a rust library and application implementing API requests
to E621/E926 with the primary focus of downloading posts and pools.

Before anything, please read [E926's API documentation](https://e926.net/wiki_pages/2425#api),
it helps, trust me.

If you're new to asynchronous programming in Rust (like me), you should read
[the async book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/), and maybe
even [tokio's tutorial](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial).

## Current State

`fluffyf` is currently
- barely usable
- missing a lot of features
- still lackluster in proper async implementation
- severely underdocumented

`fluffyget` is currently
- lacking pool fetching
- can't handle file based input
- etc

`fluffypost` is currently **unusable and not ready yet**

## Installation

The entire fluffyf project consists of two parts: library and binary.

### Library

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fluffyf = "0.1"
```

### Binary

Run the following on your favorite shell:

```sh
$ cargo install fluffyf
```

and assuming that you have added `$HOME/.cargo/bin` to PATH:

```sh
$ fluffyget --help
```

should output a help message.

## Features

Features can be enabled through `Cargo.toml`, either by:

```toml
[dependencies]
fluffyf = { version = "0.1", features = ["rate-limit"] }
```

or:

```toml
[dependencies]

[dependencies.fluffyf]
default-features = false
features = ["rate-limit"]
version = "0.1"
```

## Versioning

Regarding versioning and breaking changes.

### SemVer

This project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). However, as of January 2024, this project has not reached
version `1.0.0` yet.<br>
As such, **expect extreme amounts of breaking changes per minor version changes**

### MSRV

Due to the nature of async programming in Rust, fluffyf is almost forced
to use a very high (or "cutting-edge") minimum supported Rust version.

Note: after `1.0.0`, MSRV changes will only happen every major version change.

### Changelogging

This project follows [keep a changelog version 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
